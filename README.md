## 🎯 Overview
This project implements an automated "closed-loop" monitoring system that demonstrates production-grade DevOps, NetDevOps, and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices. The Python engine dynamically discovers network device inventory from NetBox (Source of Truth) and streams real-time ICMP telemetry to a time-series database for visualization and analysis.

**Key Achievement:** Successfully migrated from hardcoded credentials to enterprise-grade secret management, demonstrating security incident response and remediation capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture



### 🛠️ Core Components
* **Source of Truth:** NetBox (Dockerized) provides the list of active devices and management IPs.
* **Telemetry Store:** InfluxDB 2.7 stores high-resolution ICMP latency data.
* **Visualization:** Grafana Dashboards provide real-time NOC-style visibility.
* **Automation Engine:** A Python `systemd` service that handles non-privileged ICMP polling.

## 🔐 Security & Credential Management

This project implements **enterprise-grade security practices**:

### Secure Configuration
- ✅ **Centralized Secret Management:** All credentials stored in `.env` file (excluded from version control)
- ✅ **Environment Variable Injection:** Docker Compose uses `${VARIABLE}` syntax
- ✅ **Zero Hardcoded Credentials:** All Python scripts use `os.getenv()` for secure credential access
- ✅ **Template-Based Setup:** `.env.example` provides safe onboarding for new developers
- ✅ **Network Isolation:** Tailscale VPN (100.89.136.43) for private service communication

### Security Incident Response
**January 2026:** Successfully identified and remediated hardcoded credentials in git history:
- Rotated all exposed API tokens and passwords within 1 hour
- Implemented environment variable substitution across all services
- Documented incident in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) following industry best practices
- See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed timeline

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- NetBox instance (Project 1 or separate deployment)
- Tailscale VPN configured (optional but recommended)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd netdevops-project2
```

2. **Configure credentials (IMPORTANT)**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual credentials:
# - NETBOX_TOKEN (from NetBox Admin → API Tokens)
# - INFLUX_TOKEN (from InfluxDB → Data → API Tokens)
nano .env
```

3. **Start the monitoring stack**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. **Verify deployment**
```bash
python3 verify_stack.py
```

5. **Run the health poller**
```bash
python3 health_poller.py
```

### Management Commands
* **Check System Health:** `python3 verify_stack.py`
* **Bulk Provision Devices:** `python3 bulk_provision.py` (Idempotent)
* **Discover NetBox Inventory:** `python3 get_slugs.py`
* **Graceful Shutdown:** `./shutdown_lab.sh`
